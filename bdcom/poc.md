# Running SAS Code from a .sas File Faster with Python – Proof-of-Concept (POC)

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to execute SAS code stored in an external `.sas` file using the [saspy](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy) library, and then leverage Python’s advanced data processing frameworks (such as Pandas, Dask, and PySpark) to enhance performance.

## Prerequisites

- **SAS Environment:** Access to a licensed SAS installation or SAS University Edition.
- **Python 3.x:** A recent version of Python must be installed.
- **Required Python Libraries:** `saspy`, `pandas`, `dask`, and `pyspark`.

## Installing and Configuring SASPy

### Installing SASPy

Install SASPy using pip:

```bash
pip install saspy
```

## Configuring the SASPy Connection

Create or update a configuration file (typically named sascfg_personal.py) in your working directory. For example:

SAS_config_names = ['default']

default = {
    'java': '/usr/bin/java',    # Path to your Java executable
    'iomhost': 'localhost',     # SAS Integration host
    'iomport': 8591,            # Port number (verify with your SAS installation)
    'authkey': 'saspykey',      # Optional authentication key
    'encoding': 'utf-8'         # Character encoding
}

Test the configuration with the following Python snippet:

import saspy
sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='default')
print(sas)

If a SAS session launches successfully, your configuration is correct.

Running SAS Code from a .sas File

Assume you have a SAS file named my_script.sas with the following content:

/* my_script.sas */
data work.test;
    set sashelp.class;
run;

Now, you can execute this SAS code from Python as follows:

import saspy

# Start the SAS session
sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='default')

# Read SAS code from the file
with open('my_script.sas', 'r') as file:
    sas_code = file.read()

# Submit the SAS code
result = sas.submit(sas_code)
print("SAS Log:")
print(result['LOG'])

Proof-of-Concept (POC)

Below is a complete Python script demonstrating the full workflow: reading SAS code from a file, executing it, converting the resulting SAS dataset to a Pandas DataFrame, and measuring performance.

import saspy
import time
import pandas as pd

# 1. Start the SAS session
sas = saspy.SASsession(cfgname='default')

# 2. Read SAS code from 'my_script.sas'
with open('my_script.sas', 'r') as file:
    sas_code = file.read()

# 3. Submit the SAS code and measure execution time
start_time = time.time()
result = sas.submit(sas_code)
sas_elapsed = time.time() - start_time
print("SAS Code Execution Time: {:.3f} seconds".format(sas_elapsed))
print("SAS Log:\n", result['LOG'])

# 4. Convert the SAS dataset (WORK.TEST) into a Pandas DataFrame and measure the time taken
start_time = time.time()
df = sas.sd2df(table='test', libref='work')
conversion_elapsed = time.time() - start_time
print("Data Conversion Time: {:.3f} seconds".format(conversion_elapsed))
print("Data Preview:\n", df.head())

# 5. Process data using Pandas (calculating summary statistics) and measure processing time
start_time = time.time()
summary = df.describe()
processing_elapsed = time.time() - start_time
print("Pandas Computation Time: {:.3f} seconds".format(processing_elapsed))
print("Summary Statistics:\n", summary)

Using Additional Python Libraries for Performance

Pandas

Pandas offers efficient, in-memory data processing. For example:

summary = df.describe()
print(summary)

Dask

Dask allows you to scale Pandas workflows by processing data in parallel and out-of-core:

import dask.dataframe as dd

# Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Dask DataFrame with 4 partitions
ddf = dd.from_pandas(df, npartitions=4)
mean_age = ddf['Age'].mean().compute()
print("Mean Age:", mean_age)

PySpark

PySpark is ideal for distributed data processing on large datasets:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SAS Data Processing").getOrCreate()

# Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(df)
spark_df.createOrReplaceTempView("test")
result_df = spark.sql("SELECT AVG(Age) as avg_age FROM test")
result_df.show()



⸻

Conclusion

By storing SAS code in an external .sas file and executing it with SASPy, you can seamlessly integrate SAS workflows into Python. Leveraging additional Python libraries like Pandas, Dask, and PySpark allows you to build flexible, high-performance data processing pipelines.

Happy coding and efficient data processing!

**Key Tip:**  
Always ensure that every code block is correctly closed by using triple backticks (`\`\`\``) on their own line. This prevents the markdown parser from treating subsequent text as part of the code block.

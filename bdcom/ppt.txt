Slide 4: Summary Tab – At-a-Glance Health Check
	•	Columns:
	•	Missing-value counts (current vs prior month)
	•	Month-over-month diff (anomaly count)
	•	Editable “Comment” fields for each metric
	•	Four dropdown filters to narrow by count ranges
	•	Image: Screenshot of Summary tab with filters applied

⸻

Slide 5: Filtering & Commenting Workflow
	1.	Apply any combination of Missing or Diff filters
	2.	Click a row to load that field’s details in the lower tabs
	3.	Enter observations in the detail tab’s comment box
	4.	Click “Add Comment” → appears inline in Summary

	•	Image: Sequence: filter panel → selected row highlight → comment entry → updated summary

Slide 9: SAS History Tab
	•	Surfaces the bref_14M_final.sas script: filename + code excerpt
	•	“Select Fields” multi-select and “Threshold (%)” input
	•	Table below shows only selected fields whose script output ≥ threshold
	•	Image: Screenshot of SAS History tab with threshold filter active

⸻

Slide 10: SAS Ad-hoc Execution Tab
	•	Free-text editor for entering any SAS code snippet
	•	“Run SAS” button (placeholder) for future dynamic execution
	•	Static panels:
	•	Log Output placeholder
	•	Data Output placeholder
	•	Image: Screenshot of Ad-hoc tab showing code area and placeholders

⸻

Slide 11: End-to-End Analyst Workflow
	1.	Make gating selections (Portfolio, Report, Month)
	2.	Filter Summary to identify fields of interest
	3.	Drill into Value Distribution & Pop-Comp for context
	4.	Annotate findings via “Add Comment”
	5.	Review all notes in Comments tab
	6.	Adjust SAS History threshold → inspect script outputs
	7.	Draft or paste SAS in Ad-hoc for quick checks

	•	Image: Flowchart illustrating these seven steps

⸻

Slide 12: Best Practices
	•	Keep input.xlsx up-to-date with scheduled SAS runs
	•	Use clear prefixes in comments (e.g. “QA:”, “Action:”)
	•	Calibrate SAS History threshold to match data volumes
	•	Leverage SQL panels for reproducible queries in other tools

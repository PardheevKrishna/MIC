Slide 1: BDCOMM FRY14M Field Analysis Dashboard
	•	Purpose: Unified interface for field-level data quality review
	•	Key Features: Missing‐value tracking, anomaly detection, collaborative comments, SAS integration

⸻

Slide 2: Agenda
	•	Data preparation pipeline
	•	Summary tab overview
	•	Deep dives: Value Distribution & Population Comparison
	•	Historical context with Previous Comments
	•	SAS History: threshold-based insights
	•	SAS Ad-hoc execution for targeted checks
	•	End-to-end analyst workflow

⸻

Slide 3: Data Preparation Pipeline
	•	SAS jobs run nightly to cleanse and aggregate raw source data
	•	Outputs written to input.xlsx with:
	•	Data sheet: field-level counts & labels
	•	Control sheet: metadata and SQL logic
	•	Ensures standardized input for the dashboard

⸻

Slide 4: Pre-executed SAS Repository
	•	All research-grade SAS scripts have been run against master data
	•	Results captured per script and per field in an internal store
	•	Dashboard surfaces script names, code snippets, and output values

⸻

Slide 5: Summary Tab – Quick Health Check
	•	Columns:
	•	Missing values (Current vs. Prior month)
	•	Month-over-month anomaly counts (pop-comp)
	•	Inline comment fields for both metrics
	•	Filters: Four dropdowns to narrow by any count range
	•	Empowers analysts to pinpoint fields needing attention

⸻

Slide 6: Filtering & Commenting in Summary
	1.	Apply filters on missing or diff counts to shortlist fields
	2.	Select a row to load its detail in adjacent tabs
	3.	Add comments in the detail view; comments flow back into Summary
	4.	Maintains a live audit trail of observations

⸻

Slide 7: Value Distribution Tab
	•	Displays the last 13 months of value-label counts for the chosen field
	•	Includes a “Total” row for overall volume context
	•	SQL panel shows the exact query used to generate the view
	•	Copy-and-paste directly into your BI or database tool

⸻

Slide 8: Population Comparison Tab
	•	Focuses on predefined pop-comp conditions (e.g. “Prior Null → Current Pop”)
	•	Month-by-month counts of flagged anomalies only
	•	Built-in SQL panel for the anomaly logic
	•	Tracks emergence and resolution of data-population issues

⸻

Slide 9: Previous Comments Tab
	•	Historical comments for each field across the last 12 months
	•	Organized month-by-month side by side
	•	“Show All Fields” resets to global view
	•	Enables trend analysis of recurring issues or resolved items

⸻

Slide 10: SAS History Tab
	•	Lists all pre-executed SAS scripts with filename and code excerpt
	•	Value Threshold input lets you set a numeric cutoff
	•	Below, table populates every field whose script output ≥ threshold
	•	Quickly isolate fields exceeding your chosen limit

⸻

Slide 11: SAS Ad-hoc Execution Tab
	•	Pre-loaded template SAS code for common one-off checks
	•	Run SAS launches execution and returns:
	•	Log Output with execution notes
	•	Data Output showing the first few observations
	•	Facilitates targeted investigations without leaving the dashboard

⸻

Slide 12: End-to-End Analyst Workflow
	1.	Review Summary filters to identify hot spots
	2.	Drill into Value Distribution & Pop-Comp for chosen field
	3.	Annotate findings with contextual comments
	4.	Compare against past months in Previous Comments
	5.	Adjust SAS History threshold to spotlight scripted results
	6.	Perform ad-hoc SAS checks for deeper digs

⸻

Slide 13: Best Practices
	•	Schedule nightly SAS prep to keep input.xlsx fresh
	•	Use consistent prefixes in comments (e.g. “QA:”, “Action:”)
	•	Calibrate your threshold in SAS History based on data volume
	•	Leverage copy-and-paste SQL snippets for reproducibility

⸻

Slide 14: Support & Resources
	•	Documentation: Detailed user guide and SQL logic reference
	•	Training: Hands-on workshops and office hours
	•	Helpdesk: Slack #data-quality or email analytics@company.com

⸻

Slide 15: Q&A
	•	Open floor for questions
	•	Live walkthrough of any tab upon request

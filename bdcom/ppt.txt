Slide 1: BDCOMM FRY14M Field Analysis Dashboard
	•	Unified interface for field-level data-quality review
	•	Key features: missing-value tracking, anomaly detection, collaborative comments, SAS integrations
	•	Underlying data prepared nightly via SAS jobs into a standardized Excel

⸻

Slide 2: Agenda
	•	Data preparation pipeline (Data & Control sheets)
	•	Summary tab: filters & comments
	•	Value Distribution & Pop-Comp deep dives
	•	Comments tab: consolidated user notes
	•	SAS History: threshold-driven insights
	•	SAS Ad-hoc: targeted code execution
	•	End-to-end analyst workflow & best practices

⸻

Slide 3: Data Preparation Pipeline
	•	Nightly SAS jobs cleanse and aggregate raw source data
	•	Output written to input.xlsx with two sheets:
	•	Data: field-level counts, labels, metrics
	•	Control: metadata (field descriptions, thresholds, domain rules)
	•	Guarantees consistent inputs for every dashboard cycle

⸻

Slide 4: Pre-executed SAS Repository
	•	All core SAS scripts have been run against master data in UNIX
	•	Repository holds:
	•	Script filenames & code snippets
	•	Per-field output values used for research and thresholds
	•	Surfaced in the SAS History tab for quick reference

⸻

Slide 5: Summary Tab – Quick Health Check
	•	Columns:
	•	Missing-value count (current vs. prior month)
	•	Month-over-month diff (anomaly count)
	•	Editable comment fields for each metric
	•	Filters: Four dropdowns to narrow by any count range
	•	Pinpoint fields needing immediate attention

⸻

Slide 6: Filtering & Commenting in Summary
	1.	Apply filters on missing or diff counts to shortlist fields
	2.	Select a row to load its details in the detail tabs
	3.	Add comments in the Value Distribution or Pop-Comp tab
	4.	Comments automatically appear back in the Summary grid

⸻

Slide 7: Value Distribution Tab
	•	Shows last 13 months of counts per value label for the selected field
	•	Includes a “Total” row for overall volume context
	•	Built-in SQL panel delivers the exact query for this view
	•	Copy directly into your BI tool or SQL editor
Image: Screenshot of the Value Distribution grid alongside the SQL panel

⸻

Slide 8: Population Comparison Tab
	•	Focus on predefined anomaly conditions (e.g. “Prior Null → Current Pop”)
	•	Month-by-month counts of only the flagged values
	•	SQL snippet below ensures reproducibility of logic

⸻

Slide 9: Comments Tab
	•	Consolidated view of all user comments by field and month
	•	“Show All Fields” button clears any field filter
	•	Track collaborative notes without mixing in raw metrics
Image: Screenshot of the Comments tab showing comment columns and “Show All Fields” button

⸻

Slide 10: SAS History Tab
	•	Lists pre-executed SAS scripts (filename & code excerpt)
	•	Value Threshold input: set a numeric cutoff
	•	Table below shows every field whose script output meets or exceeds the threshold
Image: Screenshot of the SAS History tab with threshold input and filtered output table

⸻

Slide 11: SAS Ad-hoc Execution Tab
	•	Pre-loaded template SAS code for common on-the-fly checks
	•	“Run SAS” button executes code and returns:
	•	Log Output with execution notes
	•	Data Output preview of the first few rows
	•	Enables quick investigations without external SAS sessions

⸻

Slide 12: End-to-End Analyst Workflow
	1.	Filter Summary to identify hot spots
	2.	Drill into Value Distribution & Pop-Comp for context
	3.	Annotate findings via comments in the detail tabs
	4.	Review consolidated comments in the Comments tab
	5.	Adjust SAS History threshold to spotlight scripted outputs
	6.	Perform targeted Ad-hoc SAS checks as needed
Image: Flowchart diagram illustrating the six workflow steps

⸻

Slide 13: Best Practices
	•	Schedule nightly SAS prep to keep input.xlsx up to date
	•	Use clear comment prefixes (e.g. “QA:”, “Action:”)
	•	Calibrate your SAS History threshold based on data volumes
	•	Copy-and-paste SQL snippets for reproducibility in other tools

Slide 1: Welcome & Objectives
	•	BDCOMM FRY14M Field Analysis Dashboard
	•	Walk through how analysts interact with key tabs
	•	Understand background data prep, comment workflows, and SAS integrations

⸻

Slide 2: Agenda
	•	Data preparation & Excel generation
	•	Summary tab: filtering & commenting
	•	Deep dives: Value Distribution & Pop-Comp
	•	Historical context: Previous Comments
	•	SAS History: threshold-based script outputs
	•	SAS Ad-hoc: example code & sample results
	•	Typical analyst workflow & tips

⸻

Slide 3: Data Prep Background
	•	Overnight SAS jobs (via saspy) run over raw data
	•	Produce input.xlsx with “Data” and “Control” sheets
	•	Ensures consistent field-level metrics for the dashboard

⸻

Slide 4: Pre-executed SAS Repository
	•	All research-purpose SAS scripts already run on UNIX
	•	Results stored as:
	•	Script filenames & code
	•	Per-field output values
	•	Ready for threshold-based inspection in the dashboard

⸻

Slide 5: Summary Tab – Spot-Check Key Metrics
	•	View each field’s:
	•	Missing-value count (current vs prior month)
	•	Month-over-month diff (anomaly count)
	•	Free-text comments for both metrics
	•	Four dropdowns let you narrow fields by any count range
	•	Insert SS of filtered Summary table

⸻

Slide 6: Adding Comments in Summary
	•	Click a field row to select it
	•	In the detail tabs, enter observations in the comment box
	•	“Add Comment” pushes your note back into the Summary grid
	•	Keeps analyst notes centrally visible

⸻

Slide 7: Value Distribution Tab
	•	Shows last 13 months of counts per value label for the selected field
	•	“Total” row highlights overall volume
	•	Copy-ready SQL snippet below for reproducibility
	•	Insert SS of Value Distribution view

⸻

Slide 8: Population Comparison Tab
	•	Focused on predefined anomaly phrases (pop-comp flags)
	•	Month-by-month counts of those conditions only
	•	Built-in SQL panel to copy the exact logic
	•	Insert SS of Population Comparison view

⸻

Slide 9: Previous Comments Tab
	•	Displays past 12 months of comments per field, by month
	•	“Show All Fields” button resets any field filter
	•	Quickly spot recurring issues or improvements over time
	•	Insert SS of Previous Comments view

⸻

Slide 10: SAS History Tab
	•	Lists all pre-executed SAS scripts (filename & code)
	•	Value Threshold input: set a numeric cutoff
	•	Below, table shows every field whose script-output ≥ threshold
	•	Instantly identify fields exceeding your chosen limit
	•	Insert SS of SAS History with threshold filter

⸻

Slide 11: SAS Ad-hoc Execution Tab
	•	Pre-populated example SAS block for demo
	•	Click “Run SAS” to see simulated log messages
	•	Sample output table shows the first 5 observations
	•	Enables one-off checks without leaving the dashboard
	•	Insert SS of Ad-hoc code + log + data view

⸻

Slide 12: Typical Analyst Workflow
	1.	Filter Summary for fields of interest
	2.	Select a field → review Value Distribution & Pop-Comp
	3.	Comment findings directly in the dashboard
	4.	Compare with past notes in Previous Comments
	5.	Adjust SAS History threshold → inspect script outputs
	6.	Run quick Ad-hoc SAS checks as needed

⸻

Slide 13: Best Practices & Support
	•	Update input.xlsx daily via scheduled SAS jobs
	•	Use clear prefixes in comments (e.g. “QA:…”, “Dev:…”)
	•	Calibrate your SAS History threshold for each review cycle
	•	Reach out on Slack #data-quality or email analytics@company.com

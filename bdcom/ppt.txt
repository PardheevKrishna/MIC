Slide 3: Data Prep & Gating Flow
	•	Nightly SAS jobs build input.xlsx (Data + Control sheets)
	•	Control sheet holds metadata: field descriptions, thresholds, domain rules
	•	Gating dropdowns:
	1.	Portfolio
	2.	Report version
	3.	Month
	•	Dashboard appears only after all three selected
	•	Image: ETL pipeline → Excel → three dropdowns → dashboard

⸻

Slide 4: Summary Tab – Quick Health Check
	•	Columns:
	•	Missing-value counts (current vs prior month)
	•	Month-over-month diff (anomaly count)
	•	Editable “Comment Missing” & “Comment M2M” fields
	•	Four dropdown filters to narrow by any count range
	•	Image: Screenshot of Summary tab with filters applied

⸻

Slide 5: Filtering & Commenting Workflow
	1.	Apply any combination of missing/diff filters
	2.	Click a row to load that field’s details in detail tabs
	3.	Enter observations in Value Dist. or Pop-Comp comment box
	4.	Click “Add Comment” → appears inline in Summary

	•	Image: Sequence: filter selection → row highlight → comment entry → updated summary

⸻

Slide 6: Value Distribution Tab
	•	Shows last 13 months of counts per value label for selected field
	•	“Total” row for overall volume context
	•	SQL panel displays the exact query used
	•	Image: Screenshot of Value Distribution table + SQL snippet

⸻

Slide 7: Population Comparison Tab
	•	Focus on defined anomaly phrases (e.g. “Prior Null → Current Pop”)
	•	Month-by-month counts of flagged records only
	•	SQL panel for reproducibility of anomaly logic
	•	Image: Screenshot of Pop-Comp table + SQL snippet

⸻

Slide 8: Comments Tab
	•	Consolidated view of all user comments by field & month
	•	“Show All Fields” button resets any filter
	•	Compare current findings against past notes side-by-side
	•	Image: Screenshot of Comments tab with several monthly columns

⸻

Slide 9: SAS History Tab
	•	Displays bref_14M_final.sas filename & code excerpt
	•	Multi-select “Fields” + “Threshold (%)” input
	•	Below: for each selected field ≥ threshold, a sample output table (value_label & pct)
	•	Image: Screenshot showing threshold inputs and two sample tables for different fields

⸻

Slide 10: SAS Ad-hoc Execution Tab
	•	Free-text editor to paste any SAS code snippet
	•	“Run SAS” button executes and returns:
	•	Log Output (execution messages)
	•	Data Output (sample 5-row table with your code’s SELECT results)
	•	Image: Screenshot showing code editor, log panel, and generated sample data table

⸻

Slide 11: End-to-End Analyst Workflow
	1.	Select Portfolio → Report → Month
	2.	Filter Summary to highlight fields
	3.	Drill into Value Dist. & Pop-Comp for context
	4.	Annotate via comments in detail tabs
	5.	Review historical notes in Comments tab
	6.	Set threshold & view sample outputs in SAS History
	7.	Paste/run custom SAS in Ad-hoc for one-off checks

	•	Image: Flowchart connecting the seven steps

⸻

Slide 12: Best Practices
	•	Keep input.xlsx refreshed via scheduled SAS runs
	•	Use clear prefixes in comments (e.g. “QA:”, “Action:”)
	•	Tune SAS History threshold to your data volume
	•	Copy-paste SQL panels into your BI or query tools for reproducibility

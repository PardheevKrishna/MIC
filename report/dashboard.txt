The key objectives of this project were:
	•	Data Visualization: To present a clear and concise view of employee work performance, including time spent on tasks, completion rates, and any violations.
	•	Violation Detection: To identify any deviations from expected performance, including violations of company policies (e.g., missing deadlines or incomplete tasks).
	•	User-Friendly Interface: To ensure the dashboard was easy to navigate for HR teams and managers, enabling them to gain insights quickly and take necessary actions.

Tools and Technologies Used
	•	Frontend: Streamlit
	•	Backend: Python (pandas, numpy)
	•	Database: Excel
	•	Visualization: Streamlit charts and tables

2. Project Planning and Design

Initial Requirements Gathering

The first step was to understand the specific needs of Wells Fargo’s HR team and management. Discussions focused on what data they needed to monitor, how violations should be detected, and which key performance indicators (KPIs) would be most useful for tracking employee work. Some key data points included:
	•	Task Completion Rates: Percentage of tasks completed on time.
	•	Violation Tracking: Instances of missed deadlines, insufficient work hours, or policy violations.
	•	Employee Productivity: Time spent on individual tasks or overall workload.

Design Considerations

For this dashboard, the goal was to create a tool that could be used by non-technical users (HR and management teams) to make quick data-driven decisions. To achieve this, the dashboard needed to:
	•	Be Intuitive: Use clear visual indicators and simple navigation to make the data easy to digest.
	•	Offer Real-Time Analysis: Ensure that the dashboard updated in real-time, so HR teams could get the most up-to-date information.
	•	Provide Customization: Allow managers to filter and segment data based on different criteria (e.g., by department, by employee, or by task type).

Wireframes and UI Design

The dashboard was designed to have the following sections:
	•	Employee Summary: An overview of all employees, including performance metrics like task completion rates, hours worked, and violations.
	•	Violation Trends: A section that highlights violations over time, such as missed deadlines or incomplete tasks.
	•	Employee Details: An area for managers to select individual employees and view detailed reports on their work activities and violations.
	•	Data Filters: Allow HR to filter data by department, task type, or time period.

3. Development Process

Frameworks and Tools Used
	•	Streamlit (Frontend): Streamlit was used for building the dashboard’s interface. It enabled quick development of interactive visualizations and made it easy to connect to the backend.
	•	Python (Backend): Python was used to handle data manipulation, calculations, and integration with the Excel database. The pandas library was essential for analyzing the work data, while numpy was used for any advanced numerical operations.
	•	Excel (Database): Employee work data, including task details, time spent, and violation reports, was stored in Excel. Excel was chosen for its ease of use and accessibility within the organization.

Key Challenges and How They Were Addressed
	•	Challenge 1: Handling Large Data Sets in Excel
Solution: Excel was not originally designed for handling large datasets, but by using Python’s pandas library, I was able to load, manipulate, and analyze the data efficiently. The Excel sheets were structured in a way that ensured fast querying and updates.
	•	Challenge 2: Real-Time Data Updates
Solution: Streamlit allowed for real-time updates. Every time new data was added or a filter was applied, the dashboard was refreshed instantly, showing up-to-date statistics without the need for page reloads.
	•	Challenge 3: Defining and Detecting Violations
Solution: I created custom algorithms in Python to automatically detect violations based on pre-set criteria (e.g., task completion time exceeding a limit, incomplete tasks, or violations of company policies). The violations were flagged and displayed on the dashboard in an easy-to-understand format.

Code Example (Backend Logic for Violation Detection):

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

# Load the data from Excel
df = pd.read_excel('employee_work_data.xlsx', sheet_name='tasks')

# Function to detect violations
def detect_violations(task_data):
    task_data['Violation'] = task_data['Time Spent'] > task_data['Expected Time']
    return task_data

# Apply violation detection logic
df = detect_violations(df)

# Display the data in the Streamlit app
st.write("Employee Task Performance:")
st.dataframe(df[['Employee ID', 'Task Description', 'Time Spent', 'Violation']])

4. Features and Functionalities

Detailed Breakdown of Features
	•	Employee Overview: A high-level overview of each employee’s performance, showing their total number of tasks completed, average time spent per task, and violation rates.
	•	Task Completion Metrics: Displays how many tasks each employee completed on time, versus tasks that were delayed.
	•	Violation Detection: The dashboard automatically detects violations based on predefined rules, such as late task completion or failure to meet time targets. Violations are color-coded to make them easily identifiable.
	•	Charts and Graphs: Streamlit’s native support for charts (e.g., bar graphs, line charts) was used to visualize trends, such as:
	•	Task Completion Trends over time.
	•	Violation Frequency across different departments or teams.

Example: Task Completion Trend Visualization

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a simple line chart to show task completion over time
completion_data = df.groupby('Date')['Completed Tasks'].sum()

# Plot the data
st.line_chart(completion_data)

Violation Detection Logic

The system flagged potential violations by comparing the actual time spent on a task with the expected time (or any other company-set threshold). If an employee exceeded the expected time for a task, the violation was flagged and visually indicated on the dashboard for easy follow-up by the manager.

Data Filtering

HR and managers were able to filter the data by:
	•	Department: View performance data for specific departments.
	•	Employee: Focus on individual employee performance.
	•	Time Period: Analyze performance over different time ranges (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly).

5. Testing and Deployment

Testing Methodology

The following testing methods were employed:
	•	Unit Testing: Python functions, particularly the data handling functions and violation detection logic, were tested to ensure correctness.
	•	Integration Testing: The Streamlit frontend was tested with the backend to ensure the dashboard displayed real-time updates accurately.
	•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): HR and management teams conducted usability testing, providing valuable feedback on the dashboard’s layout and functionality. This led to enhancements in the UI for better clarity and ease of use.

Deployment

The dashboard was deployed internally, accessible via a secure internal server at Wells Fargo. Only authorized users (HR and managers) were given access to the dashboard, ensuring the confidentiality of employee data.

6. Impact and Future Enhancements

Impact

The dashboard significantly improved how Wells Fargo managed and tracked employee performance. By using visual indicators and real-time data updates, managers and HR staff were able to detect issues faster, make data-driven decisions, and ensure that employees adhered to company guidelines. Violations were flagged promptly, enabling corrective action to be taken sooner.

Future Enhancements
	•	Advanced Violation Analysis: Adding more sophisticated rules to detect different types of violations (e.g., employee inefficiencies, non-compliance with policies).
	•	Predictive Analytics: Implementing machine learning models to predict future violations based on historical trends.
	•	Performance Benchmarks: Integrating benchmarks or KPIs to help compare employee performance against company-wide standards.

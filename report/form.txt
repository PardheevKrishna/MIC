1. Introduction

Overview of the Project

This project aimed to create a streamlined form for tracking employee work within Wells Fargo, utilizing Python, Streamlit, and Excel for the backend, frontend, and database, respectively. The primary goal was to automate the process of tracking employees’ work activities, enabling more efficient reporting, real-time data collection, and reducing manual labor previously involved in performance reviews. The form was designed for internal use only, serving Wells Fargo’s HR team and management.

Objective and Goals
	•	To develop a user-friendly form that allows managers to track employee work performance in real-time.
	•	To ensure that the form’s functionality allows easy data entry, validation, and visualization.
	•	To replace outdated manual processes with a more efficient, automated form-based solution.
	•	To integrate with Excel, making it easy for the company to store, analyze, and manipulate data.

Tools and Technologies Used
	•	Python: Used for backend processing, data handling, and form submission logic.
	•	Streamlit: A powerful Python library used for creating web-based interactive dashboards and applications, which was employed here for building the form’s user interface.
	•	Excel: Utilized as a lightweight database solution to store employee work data, leveraging its easy-to-use interface for internal data management.

2. Project Planning and Design

Initial Requirements Gathering

The development of the employee work tracking form started with understanding the requirements of the stakeholders. Key requirements included:
	•	Types of Data: Tracking the time spent on tasks, task descriptions, feedback, and violations (e.g., missing deadlines, failure to meet targets).
	•	Data Security: Since the application would be used internally within Wells Fargo, security and confidentiality of employee data were prioritized.
	•	Ease of Use: The application needed to be easy for employees to use, even for those who might not be familiar with complex software tools.

Design Considerations

Streamlit was chosen as the frontend technology because of its ability to create interactive forms and dashboards with minimal effort. It allows rapid prototyping of Python-based web applications.
The form was designed with the following principles:
	•	Simplicity: A clean, minimalistic design to avoid distractions for the users.
	•	Real-time Validation: Instant feedback for the user on their input (e.g., a warning for missing required fields).
	•	Customization: The form could be adapted to capture specific employee data based on department-specific needs.

The Excel database was designed to include separate sheets for:
	•	Employee Information: Employee IDs, names, and departments.
	•	Task Tracking: Task descriptions, time spent, and status updates.
	•	Violation Tracking: Record of any work-related violations (if any).

Wireframes and UI Design:
Streamlit’s simple components were used for the form interface, such as text inputs, date pickers, checkboxes, and radio buttons. The wireframes were kept simple, with collapsible sections for task details, feedback, and violation tracking.

3. Development Process

Frameworks and Tools Used
	•	Backend (Python): The backend was fully developed using Python. Data handling, input validation, and integration with Excel were all done in Python. The pandas library was used to manipulate the data within Excel files.
	•	Frontend (Streamlit): Streamlit was used to build the interactive user interface for the form. This included dynamic form elements, such as date pickers, dropdowns, and text boxes. Streamlit was also used to display the status of form submissions and any errors.
	•	Database (Excel): The form data was stored in an Excel file. This was used because of its simplicity and accessibility within the organization, allowing for easy data entry, manipulation, and reporting by internal teams.

Key Challenges and How They Were Addressed
	•	Challenge 1: Managing Large Excel Files
Solution: Excel was not designed for high-volume, concurrent data entry. To mitigate this, the application was built to update Excel files only when the user submitted the form, ensuring data was processed in batches. This helped prevent potential data corruption or lag.
	•	Challenge 2: Ensuring Real-time Feedback
Solution: Streamlit’s real-time updates allowed immediate validation and user feedback on submitted data. For example, if a user left a required field empty, the form would display an error message in real time.
	•	Challenge 3: User Input Validation
Solution: Input validation for fields such as time spent, task descriptions, and violations was implemented using Python’s built-in features. Streamlit provided error messages that helped guide users to enter correct data.

Code Example (Backend Logic for Data Submission):

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

def submit_form(employee_id, task_description, time_spent, violation):
    # Load the existing Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel('employee_work_data.xlsx', sheet_name='tasks')
    
    # Create a new record
    new_record = {
        'Employee ID': employee_id,
        'Task Description': task_description,
        'Time Spent (hrs)': time_spent,
        'Violation': violation
    }
    
    # Append the new record to the DataFrame
    df = df.append(new_record, ignore_index=True)
    
    # Save the updated DataFrame back to Excel
    df.to_excel('employee_work_data.xlsx', index=False)
    
    st.success("Form submitted successfully!")

4. Features and Functionalities

Detailed Breakdown of Features
	•	Employee Information: The form captured key employee data (e.g., ID, name, department) to ensure the task was tracked to the correct individual.
	•	Task Tracking: Users could input task descriptions, time spent, and the status of each task (e.g., completed, in-progress). The form also supported validating the hours worked to ensure no discrepancies.
	•	Violation Tracking: A section for reporting violations, such as late submissions or missed targets, was incorporated into the form.
	•	Reporting and Visualization: Streamlit allowed for generating simple visualizations (like task completion rates or violations per employee), which helped management get insights into employee performance.

Integration with Excel:

Data was stored and retrieved from an Excel file. The form used pandas to manipulate the data and updated the Excel file whenever a new submission was made. This made it easy to maintain and analyze data in a format already familiar to employees within Wells Fargo.

Sample Data Structure in Excel:

The Excel file included separate sheets for:
	•	Employee Information: Columns like Employee ID, Name, Department
	•	Task Tracking: Task ID, Employee ID, Task Description, Time Spent
	•	Violation Records: Violation Type, Employee ID, Date, Description

5. Testing and Deployment

Testing Methodology:

The following testing strategies were employed:
	•	Unit Testing: Ensured that each Python function (e.g., data validation, form submission) worked independently as expected.
	•	Integration Testing: Verified that data submitted through the form was accurately recorded in Excel.
	•	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Small groups of HR staff tested the form, providing feedback to improve usability.

Deployment:

The form was deployed on an internal server and was accessible within Wells Fargo’s intranet. Since this tool was designed for internal use only, access control and security were built into the form to ensure only authorized users could access and submit the form.

Act as an expert VBA developer for PowerPoint automation.  
Generate a single VBA Sub that, when run in the active presentation, will:

1. Clear all existing slides.  
2. Create exactly 10 slides, each with a title and bullet-point body.  
3. Populate each slide with content pulled from the FR Y-14M Form page (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportingforms/Report/Index/FR_Y-14M), covering:
   - FR Y-14M overview and purpose  
   - Historical background and regulatory milestones  
   - Monthly data collections and respondent panel  
   - Reporting frequency  
   - Key risk metrics (MAE, RMSE, forecast horizon)  
   - Q&A and methodology resources  
4. Position the text box on the left (e.g. Left = 50, Top = 100, Width = 400) so charts can sit to the right.  
5. Apply a professional color theme:
   - Background: light gray  
   - Titles: dark blue, Calibri Light, 32pt  
   - Body text: dark gray, Calibri, 18pt  
   - Bullet accents and chart fills: teal  
6. Add two charts:
   - Slide 4: a pie chart showing the four FR Y-14M data collections.  
   - Slide 7: a clustered-column chart showing MAE, RMSE, and 12-month forecast horizon.  
   Style chart fills using the accent color with subtle transparency.  
7. Save the presentation and display a confirmation message box.

Use only built-in PowerPoint constants (e.g. `ppLayoutText`, `msoTrue`) and avoid unsupported properties. Provide the complete VBA code ready to paste into the VBA editor.
